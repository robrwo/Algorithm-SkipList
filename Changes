Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::SkipList.

2.00_02 29 March 2010
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
	- Rewrote Algorithm::SkipList::Node. Now based on the Tree::Node
	  package, which is written in C for significant improvement in
	  memory usage, and a slight improvement in speed
	- Cleaner code in various methods
	- Option to set minimum level

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]
	- changed interface for Node package, but since it is meant for
	  internal use, this should not be a problem for most users
	- accessing the key and value accessors of the header will
	  cause an error
	- _search() and _search_with_finger() return their values in a
	  different order; again these are for internal use...
	- duplicates option renamed to allow_duplicates
	- other name and interface changes to internals
	- the levels method does not return a value equal to the
	  number of levels in the list header node (list method)
	- the order of arguments to the copy method has changed
	  to copy(low, high, finger) so as to be consistent with other
	  methods
        - The following methods are not yet implemented in this release:
            merge
            find_duplicates
            _node_by_index
            key_by_index
            index_by_key
            value_by_index

    [OTHER CHANGES]
	- Updated and reorganized documentation.
	- Rewrote tests from scratch.
	- Level threshold not readjusted during deletes.
        - Benchmarks.txt file not included with this release.
